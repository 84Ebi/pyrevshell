python reverse shell //                                                     
  1-requirements : python3 // 
                                                                                     
  2-if you want to work you have to change host ip address in both files and set it as your server ip address //                                     
                                                                                                                                      
  3-server usage: python server.py                                                                    
    client usage: python client.py //  
    
  4-you can use pyinstaller to make it as excutable file and use client side on computers without python but make sure you set the host ip on client file correct and       make sure that port is open on your internet//    
                                                                                                                             
  all cmd commands works well //                                                                                                    
                                                                                                     
i hope you enjoy <3
